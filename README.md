[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/cryptonodes-core/cryptonodes-core.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/cryptonodes-core/cryptonodes-core)  ![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mashape/apistatus.svg)

Cryptonodes (CNMC) is a sustainable cryptocurrency modeled after Satoshi Nakamotoâ€™s vision for Bitcoin. It is a decentralized, peer-to-peer transactional currency designed to offer a solution to the problem posed by the exponential increase in energy consumed by Bitcoin and other proof-of-work currencies. Proof-of-work mining is environmentally unsustainable due to the electricity used by high-powered mining hardware. Cryptonodes utilizes an energy efficient proof-of-stake algorithm, can be mined on any computer, and will never require specialized mining equipment. The Green Protocol offers a simple solution to Bitcoin sustainability issues and provides a faster, more scalable blockchain that is better suited for daily transactional use.

- Fast transactions featuring guaranteed zero confirmation transactions, we call it _SwiftTX_.
- Decentralized blockchain voting providing for consensus based advancement of the current Masternode
  technology used to secure the network and provide the above features, each Masternode is secured
  with a collateral of 5000 CNMC.

### Block reward breakdown (Block height - Reward per block)
#
#### Block 201-5,000	  -   *1.000 CNMC*
#### Block 5,001-25,000   -   *30 CNMC*
#### Block 25,001-100,000  -   *20 CNMC*
#### Block 100,001-1,050,000  -   *10 CNMC*
#### Block 1,050,001-2,100,000  -  *5 CNMC*
#### Block 2,100,001-3,150,000   -   *2,5 CNMC*
#### Block 3,150,001-2,200,000   -   *1,25 CNMC*

#### *Then the block reward splits every 1'050'000 blocks. Until the total is generated.*
